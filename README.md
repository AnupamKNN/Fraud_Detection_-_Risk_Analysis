## raud Detection & Risk Analytics for FinTechs/SMEs


### Project Context

FinTech companies, banks, e-commerce platforms, and online payment services face persistent threats from fraudulent transactions—including credit card fraud, account takeovers, fake refunds, and money laundering. Early-stage businesses and SMEs often lack advanced fraud detection tools, making them vulnerable to financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.

### Business Problem

Detecting, explaining, and managing fraudulent transactions in real-time, using machine learning and data-driven dashboards, to minimize financial risk for FinTechs/SMEs.

### Objective

 Build a deployable, automated system to identify potentially fraudulent transactions as they occur, provide actionable risk insights, and enable teams to intervene or investigate high-risk events efficiently.

### Key Constraints

Must operate within resource/hosting limits (free-tier DBs, Streamlit/Render hosting), and support scalability for increasing data volumes.

### Statement for Project Documentation

"Develop a real-time fraud detection and risk analytics platform for SMEs/FinTechs that ingests transactional and user behavior data, flags anomalies using machine learning algorithms, and provides interpretable risk scores and explanations. The system should offer an interactive dashboard for teams to review suspicious activity, understand risk drivers using explainable AI (like SHAP/LIME), and generate regulatory or management reports, all within a secure, resource-efficient stack suitable for cloud deployment on a student/free-tier budget."

### Typical Core Questions the Project Solves:

- Which transactions are potentially fraudulent, and why?

- Can we explain each risk flag to non-technical teams?

- How can analysts review and provide feedback to improve future detection?

- How do fraud trends evolve over time? Are there new attack patterns?


### Define Use Cases, Data Requirements & Target Users

#### 1. Clarify Use Cases & Personas

- Who will use your app? (e.g., fraud analyst, SME owner, compliance officer, customer support)

- What actions should they be able to perform?

    - Review flagged transactions

    - Understand why a transaction is risky

    - View overall fraud statistics/trends

    - Give feedback on transaction labeling (fraud/not fraud)

    - Export reports for compliance/audits

##### Sample Personas:

- Fraud Analyst: Reviews flagged cases, requests more details.

- Business Owner: Needs high-level risk overview, periodic reports.

- Regulator: May require evidence trail and explanations.


#### 2. Choose and Map a Dataset

- Decide which open-source dataset you’ll use (such as the popular [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset], [Ecommerce Fraud Dataset], or Amazon’s public fraud benchmarks).

- Inspect available fields: transaction amount, time, customer ID, merchant, transaction type, geographic location, etc.

- List required features and any synthetic enrichment you might perform (e.g., user feedback flags, session data).


#### 3. Sketch User Stories and Main App Structure

- “As a fraud analyst, I want to see all high-risk transactions with reasons so I can act fast.”

- “As a business owner, I want an interactive dashboard to monitor fraud trends so I can measure loss/recovery.”

- “As a compliance officer, I want exportable audit logs and explanations for each alert.”


#### 4. Plan Your MVP Feature Set

- Transaction upload/streaming or simulation.

- Outlier/fraud scoring using ML.

- Interactive dashboard with filter/search.

- Risk explanation module (model explainability: SHAP/LIME).

- Feedback loop for analyst input.

- Storage using your selected free-tier DB.

##### ACTION ITEMS:

- Pick your dataset and upload it to a local development environment.

- List user stories and diagram minimal dashboard layout (can be sketched on paper or Figma/free tool).

- Summarize key data columns you’ll use (and how they map to business actions).
